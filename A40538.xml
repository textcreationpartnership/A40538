            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

<pb n="4" facs="tcp:43511:3"/> that the villany may be wholly diſcovered, and thoſe concerned in it deſervedly puniſht.</p>
            <p>And ſo I ſhall proceed to give you an account of the Murther of Sir <hi>Edmund Bury Godfrey,</hi> who may be called the firſt Martyr in this Cauſe, For this worthy Gentleman being one of His Majeſties Juſtices of the Peace, was concerned in taking the Examinations upon the firſt Diſcovery of this Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonable deſign and (as became him) was very dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gent therein; whereby tis verily beleiv'd ſome Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſts conceived ſuch a malice againſt him as occaſio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned his lamentable Murther, for going forth on <hi>Saturday</hi> the <hi>12th.</hi> of <hi>October,</hi> from his Houſe in <hi>Greens Lane</hi> near <hi>Charing Croſs,</hi> he neither came home to Dinner, nor returned at night, which much amazed his Servants, but from that time till the <hi>Thursday</hi> following, no certain tydings could be heard of him, although all earneſt and diligent Inquieries and Searches were made for him; but on <hi>Thursday</hi> the <hi>17th.</hi> of <hi>October</hi> his body was found in a field out of any Road or Path, near a place cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led Primroſe Hill, about three miles from <hi>London,</hi> The manner how he came to be found, is Related thus, Two perſons going to an Alehouſe, called the <hi>white houſe,</hi> two or three fields off, on ſome occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, to go the neareſt way croſs over this field, and near the Hedge, ſaw as they thought, a Sword and Belt, and a ſtick and a pair of Gloves, but ſuppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing them to belong to ſome perſon that was gone into the ditch to eaſe himſelf, did not meddle with them, but told the man of the Alehouſe of it, who
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:43511:3"/> as they return'd would go with them to ſee the thing<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>, becauſe (as he ſaid) there had been ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Soldiers out that way of late a Hedge-Hog-Hunting, and poſſibly ſome of them might have careleſly left them behind them; coming to the place, they found a Belt and Scabbard, but without a ſword, and the Gloves and ſtick lying as afore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaid, and o<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>e of them going to take them up, per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived ſomething like a man in the Ditch, and going nearer, a body lying on its belly in the ditch with a ſword run clear through him and remaining therein, Hereupon they immediately called an Officer, who with ſeveral Neighbours came to the place, the ſword was run in juſt under the leſt pap, and ſtuck forth at the right ſide of his back, about ſeven or eight inches. The Officer knowing it to be the body of Sir <hi>Edmund Bury Godfrey,</hi> and <gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>aving removed it out of the ditch, found in his Pockets ſeven Guinnies, four broad pieces, and two ſmall pieces of Gold, four pound and half a crown in Sil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver, and three Gold Rings about him, tis believ'd the villains had a deſign to murther his Reputation as well as his perſon, and left him in this manner with his money, to make it be thought that <gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>e Murthered himſelf: But tis well known he was a more judicious and chriſtian perſon, and had a plentiful Eſtate, and no colour for ſuch a ſcandal, and that which makes it plain to be an inhumane Murther in them, are theſe circumſtances.</p>
            <p>Firſt, there was nothing miſſing about him but his band, and his Pocket-Book wherein he uſed to
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:43511:4"/> carry the Examinations of ſuch as came before him, which probably theſe Murderers had occaſion for, that it might be concealed.</p>
            <p>Secondly, th<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>re was no ſign of blood in the ditch, nor thereabouts to be ſeen.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, There was a Seam or Circle about his Neck, and the blood ſettled in the upper part, whereby it appears that he was firſt ſtrangled be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he was run through, and as for his large lac'd band, which he went from Home with, on, and now was miſſing, tis like being a long neckt man and uſing to wear a high Collar, when they came to ſtrangle him, he might ſtruggle, and they could not do it without tearing it to pieces, and ſo durſ<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">

               </gap> not bring any of it with the body, leaſt it ſhould diſcover the violence they had uſed to him.</p>
            <p>And laſtly, the ſoles of his ſhoes were as clean as if he had been but juſt then brought off a bed or out of a Chamber, and that he was killd elſewhere and brought thither a little before he was found is evident, becauſe on the <hi>Tueſday</hi> before, which was four days after he was firſt miſſing, the owner of this field having loſt a Calf, ſearching diligent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly along this ditch and two other men with him, and then there was <gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">

            <p>The Corps being Imbalmed, was kept till <hi>Thursday</hi> the laſt day of <hi>October,</hi> and then was car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ryed in moſt Noble manner, from the Great Hall of the Corporation of Old <hi>Bridewel</hi> (whereof he was one of the Governours) unto his late Pariſh Church being St. <hi>Martins</hi> in the Fields; never was ſeen a more ſolemn, or decent Funeral, Eight Knights, and all Juſtices of the Peace held up the Pall, All the Aldermen of the City attended the Corps, and above an hundred Miniſters that came of their own accord without any invitation, but that of reſpect to his memory, and of perſons of Quality and other company the croud was ſo great, that the Train reach'd at once from <hi>Bridewel</hi> beyond the <hi>New Exchange</hi> in the <hi>Strand,</hi> and the Church ſo crowded, that perſons of Quality had offer'd great ſumms of money to get a place in any ſeat where they might hear.</p>
